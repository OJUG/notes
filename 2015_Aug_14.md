2. Annual plannning for out of town speakers.  How can we improve the diversity of speakers?   There are places on twitter and the net where we can ask for speakers.
3. Suggested companies to ask for help: JFrog (November's speaker works there), Pivotal, Dyntrace (gave a nice talk in July)
4. Think about trying to get speakers that can talk at multiple venues: big omaha, HDC (http://www.heartlanddc.com/), Nebraska Code, NEJS, Startup weekend, computer science education week that most universities participate in
5. Think about switching speakers with @CIJUG and kcjava.org
