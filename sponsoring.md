Sometimes we get requests from a staffing firm to sponsor a meeting.   Here is a suggested standard response.    

Omaha Java Usersâ€™ Group (OJUG.org) has five long-term sponsors.   These are the primary sponsors of our meetings.   We are very grateful to them!

1. TekSystems for buying us pizza & pop year in year out; even during the recessions!
1. BCBS for the wonderful meeting space they provide OJUG.org and many other groups in the Omaha community
1. OPI for paying for our Meetup.com account.
1. Agape Red for sponsoring the after meeting get together
1. Jetbrains for giving away a license of IntelliJ IDEA at each meeting

Occasionally, we are asked by a staffing agency if they can sponsor a meeting.   
We decline these single sponsorship requests out of respect for our long-term sponsors.

The best way a staffing agency can help OJUG.org and promote their company is by doing two things:

a. Encourage the Omaha based software engineers associated with your company to volunteer as OJUG.org speakers.   
Talks can vary in length from 5 minutes to over an hour.   Sales pitches of any kind are not allowed. 
b. Do not send a large number of recruiters to OJUG.org meetings.    Our suggestion is to please limit the number 
of recruiters per agency to two.
